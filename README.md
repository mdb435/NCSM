# New College Social Media (NCSM)

NCSM is an app being developed by a group of students at NAU. NCSM is a multipurpose app that is meant to bring students on campus together. This app will improve the college experience for students that struggle to connect with others.

## Getting Started

To run with the environment that our group is using, you're going to need the Android Studio's IDE, as well as the Flutter+Dart plugin within the IDE.

Fork the ___ file, then run it using Android Studio (with Flutter) and its built-in emulator.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
Ensure that you have Virtualization turned on in your system's BIOS. The setting may be called VT-x, AMD-V, SVM, or Vanderpool.
You'll need this for the mobile device emulator.
```

## Running the tests

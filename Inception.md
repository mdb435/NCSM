D1. Inception

1. Introduction

  Our project is about making a web app that can be used by students so that they can develop a community that best fits them within the 
University they are attending. This software will be solving the problem that some students may have on campus of connecting with others 
and finding friends in university life. This can be a big problem with some students whether they be transfers or incoming freshman as 
connecting with your community can be daunting to some but being connected with life on campus can make a students college experience 
that much better.

  Transfer Student
  
  Key Insights

  Very beneficial to Transfer Students
  
  Give students a platform to get involved
  
  Representative Quotes
  
  “I like this idea because as a Transfer student myself getting connected with a new University can be scary and this could be used as   a means to make that transition easier.”
  
  “Another thing that I always notice on campus is there is always tons of flyers posted on bulletin boards across campus and sometimes   you see something you would want to attend and it already happened. Sometimes you wish that you could have known about that beforehand   and this could make it easier to get event details out to students easier.”

  Hypotheses that were validated
  
  Michael loved this idea of an app that can connect students with their community, especially when students are in certain               circumstances where they are at a disconnect with their campus. He knows how hard it can be to connect and thinks this could be a good   way to do so.

  “Almost every time I would try to navigate through NAU’s website to find what I’m looking for, I 
  would almost always find broken links. There are too many ways to get to the same place and it is 
  very confusing.”
  
  Hypotheses that were validated
  
  It seemed my interviewee was not too interested in the social media aspect, but the idea of keeping 
  all of the needed information in one concise location, which lines up with our statement of  
  “...making life on campus more convenient”.

  Interviewee 6: Nick Knaggs
  
  Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview?
  
  Nicholas Knaggs, Junior, Computer Science
  
  When?
  
  02/10/2020
  
  Consumer Segment
  
  College Students, specifically useful for freshmen and transfer students
  
  Would like for this app to connect students that are looking for friends
  
  Key Insights
  
  Linking school accounts to their profile is important to keep people responsible to what they post
  
  By connecting other students, students will have an easier time building relationships
  
  Representative Quotes
  
  “Freshman year was tough to connect with other students with similar interests. A place to connect with other students would make it     easier to enjoy the freshman experience” 

  “If people were posting about things happening on campus, this would probably make me want to participate in campus events more often”
  
  Hypotheses that were validated
  
  After finishing the interview, I concluded that the interviewee felt that he would use the app more to find events on campus and to     meet others. He felt that the current NAU app “NAUgo” does a fairly decent job at connecting students to the different university       features. However, he did seem to like the idea of having everything in one place.

  Grouping by major/interest is a good idea
  
  Would be useful to incoming college freshman
